feature_extractor.py — Extract 8 numeric features from raw JSONB snapshot data

Corrections made vs previous version:
  1.  PAUSE_THRESHOLD          — single constant replaces separate MAX_TYPING_GAP
                                  and IDLE_THRESHOLD (both were 2.0 but defined
                                  independently — risky if one was changed without
                                  the other)

  2.  all_ts sorted by parsed  — sorted(all_ts, key=_parse_ts) instead of plain
      epoch, not string         sorted(all_ts); plain string sort breaks on mixed
                                  timezone offsets e.g. "Z" vs "+05:30"

  3.  window_duration fallback  — condition changed from < 1.0 to <= 0; short but
      condition fixed            legitimate sessions (e.g. 0.3 s burst) were being
                                  silently replaced with 30 s, causing massive
                                  underestimation of typing_speed and scroll_frequency

  4.  keyups sorted by          — keyups list is now sorted by timestamp before use;
      timestamp                   previously assumed JSONB array was already ordered,
                                  which is not guaranteed by Supabase

  5.  key_duration from keyup   — key_duration now uses keyup timestamps (first/last
      timestamps, not all        keyup) to be consistent with typing_speed numerator
      key_events                  (len(keyups)); before, denominator used all
                                  key_events timestamps while numerator counted only
                                  keyups — unit mismatch

  6.  key_duration fallback      — changed from < 1.0 to <= 0 (same reason as #3)
      condition fixed

  7.  mouse_duration fallback    — changed from < 1.0 to <= 0; a fast 0.8 s burst
      condition fixed             of mouse moves was being replaced with full 30 s
                                  window, massively underestimating avg_mouse_speed

  8.  moves sorted by timestamp  — moves list sorted before use; segment-by-segment
                                  distance/speed between moves[i-1] and moves[i]
                                  is wrong if events are out of order

  9.  scrolls sorted by          — same fix applied to scroll event list
      timestamp

  10. scroll_duration fallback   — changed from < 1.0 to <= 0 (same reason as #3)
      condition fixed

  11. idle_ratio total_span      — uses keyups[0]/[-1] after sorting, so span is
      uses sorted keyups          correct; previously could use wrong endpoints if
                                  keyups were unsorted
